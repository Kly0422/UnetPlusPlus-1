# UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation

UNet++ is a new general purpose image segmentation architecture for more accurate image segmentation. UNet++ consists of U-Nets of varying depths whose decoders are densely connected at the same resolution via the redesigned skip pathways, which aim to address two key challenges of the U-Net: 1) unknown depth of the optimal architecture and 2) the unnecessarily restrictive design of skip connections.
